# Calendar Implementation Analysis

## Database Schema Analysis

After analyzing the database schema and server actions in the project, I've identified several important points:

### ID Generation

1. **Current Project Standard**: The project uses `createId()` from `@paralleldrive/cuid2` for ID generation across all tables. This is evident in:

   - The schema definitions in `src/db/schema.ts` where `.$defaultFn(() => createId())` is used for ID fields
   - Server actions in `src/app/actions/` where `createId()` is used when inserting new records
   - Seed scripts where `createId()` is used to generate IDs for test data

2. **Our Implementation**: In our `calendar.ts` server actions, we incorrectly used `nanoid()` from the `nanoid` package, which is inconsistent with the rest of the project.

### Schema Discrepancies

1. **Schema Versions**:

   - There are two schema files in the project: `src/db/schema.ts` and `drizzle/schema.ts`
   - These files have different definitions for the same tables
   - The `drizzle/schema.ts` file includes the updated fields from our migration, but `src/db/schema.ts` does not

2. **Calendar Table**:

   - In `src/db/schema.ts`, the `calendars` table does not have `year` or `updatedAt` fields
   - In `drizzle/schema.ts`, these fields are present as added by our migration

3. **CalendarEvents Table**:

   - In `src/db/schema.ts`, the `calendarEvents` table does not have `active` or `updatedAt` fields
   - In `drizzle/schema.ts`, these fields are present as added by our migration
   - The `type` field is defined as `text` in `src/db/schema.ts` but as `holidayType` enum in `drizzle/schema.ts`

4. **HolidayType Enum**:
   - The `holidayType` enum is defined in `drizzle/schema.ts` but not in `src/db/schema.ts`
   - This explains the linter errors related to the enum type

### Database Operations

1. **Date Handling**:

   - The project uses `Date` objects for database operations, not string timestamps
   - Our implementation was incorrectly using `new Date().toISOString()` for date fields

2. **Server Actions Location**:
   - Server actions should be placed in `/src/app/actions/` not in `/src/actions/`
   - This is consistent with the project structure and import paths

## Changes Made

1. **Schema Synchronization**:

   - Updated `src/db/schema.ts` to match the changes in `drizzle/schema.ts`
   - Added the `holidayTypeEnum` to `src/db/schema.ts`
   - Added the `year` and `updatedAt` fields to the `calendars` table in `src/db/schema.ts`
   - Added the `active` and `updatedAt` fields to the `calendarEvents` table in `src/db/schema.ts`
   - Updated the `type` field in `calendarEvents` to use the `holidayTypeEnum`

2. **Server Actions**:

   - Created server actions in the correct location at `/src/app/actions/calendar.ts`
   - Updated ID generation to use `createId()` from `@paralleldrive/cuid2`
   - Fixed date handling to use `Date` objects directly
   - Implemented proper error handling and validation

3. **UI Components**:

   - Updated imports in UI components to use the new server actions location
   - Created toast components for notifications
   - Fixed type definitions for calendar data

4. **Update Production Database**:

   - Applyed the migration to the production database on Neon DB Service
   - Verified that the schema changes are applied correctly

5. **Complete UI Implementation**:

   - Implemented the calendar detail page for managing holiday dates
   - Implemented the holiday date creation/edit modal
   - Implemented the CSV import UI

6. **Test the Implementation**:

   - Tested the calendar creation, update, and deletion functionality
   - Tested the holiday date management functionality
   - Tested the CSV import functionality

7. **Documentation**:
   - Document the calendar functionality for users and how the CSV import works
