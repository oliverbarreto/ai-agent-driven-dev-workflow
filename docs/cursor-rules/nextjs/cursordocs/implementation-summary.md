# Implementation Summary: Calendarios Laborales

## What We've Implemented

### Database Schema

- Extended the `calendars` table with a `year` field and `updatedAt` timestamp
- Added `active` status and `updatedAt` timestamp to the `calendarEvents` table
- Created a `holidayType` enum for the different types of holidays (Nacional, Auton√≥mico, Local, Empresa)
- Created a migration file for these schema changes
- Added proper relations between calendars and calendarEvents tables

### Validation

- Created Zod schemas for calendar validation
- Created Zod schemas for holiday date validation
- Created Zod schema for CSV import validation

### Server Actions

- Implemented CRUD operations for calendars (create, update, delete)
- Implemented CRUD operations for holiday dates (add, update, delete)
- Implemented CSV import functionality
- Implemented a function to get holiday type counts

### UI Components

- Created a calendar list component that displays calendars with their holiday type counts
- Created a calendar creation modal with form validation
- Created a calendar edit modal for updating existing calendars
- Created a calendar detail page for managing holiday dates
- Created a holiday date creation modal with form validation
- Created a holiday date edit modal for updating existing holiday dates
- Created a CSV import component with file validation and data preview
- Implemented error handling and loading states

### UI Improvements

- Set Monday as the first day of the week in date picker calendars
- Formatted dates in the holiday dates table to use dd/MM/yyyy format with Spanish locale
- Improved overall user experience with consistent date formatting

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed Next.js 15 compatibility issue by awaiting params before accessing its properties
- Resolved database schema migration issues with enum types by recreating the tables
- Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'referencedTable')" error by adding missing table relations
- Fixed type issues in the holiday date edit form by properly typing the holiday type

### Testing and Documentation

- Tested the complete functionality with real data
- Fixed remaining issues or bugs, pending build and linter bug fixes
- Added documentation for users on how the CSV import works

## What's Left to Do

### Fix Current Issues

- Fix any remaining linter errors in the components
- Ensure all components have proper type definitions
- Test the CSV import functionality with real data

### Testing and Refinement

- Test the complete functionality
- Add proper error handling for edge cases
- Optimize performance if needed
- Add documentation for users

## Implementation Decisions

### Data Model

- We decided to extend the existing `calendars` table rather than creating a new table
- We chose to calculate holiday type counts at runtime for simplicity and data consistency
- If performance becomes an issue, we can implement caching or denormalization

### UI/UX

- We implemented a table view for calendars with counts by holiday type
- We created modals for adding and editing calendars and holiday dates
- We implemented a dedicated page for managing holiday dates for each calendar
- We added CSV import functionality with data preview for better user experience
- We used consistent date formatting with Spanish locale for better readability
