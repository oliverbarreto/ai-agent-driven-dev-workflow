# Feature: Add Clerk Authentication to the app

## Documentation

We have access to the already indexed Clerk full documentation. However, it can be found online at https://clerk.com/docs/. Here is a tutorial to `Build your own sign-in-or-up page for your Next.js app with Clerk` is the following: https://clerk.com/docs/references/nextjs/custom-sign-in-or-up-page

The official documentation for Clerk's Webhooks is the following:

- [Overview](https://clerk.com/docs/webhooks/overview)
- [Sync Clerk data to your app with webhooks](https://clerk.com/docs/webhooks/sync-data)

To install and use Ngrok, this is the official documentation: https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/

## Overview

Up until now, the project only works with a mock user. We now need to add the functionality to allow the app to login/logout different users from a company which will be created using Clerk and allow them to work with the app.

### Company

The company will be the main entity of the application. It will be used to organize the users and to allow them to work together on projects.

The company will have the following fields:

COMPANIES TABLE (organizations in the current schema in the database):

- id (string cuid) @unique
- name (string)
- slug String @unique

- tagline (String?)
- description (string?)
- logo (string?)

- address (string?)
- phone (string?)
- email (string?)
- website (string?)

- createdAt DateTime @default(now())
- updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

- a list of Users
- a list of Teams

### Company Directory

The app should have a comprehensive list of teams within the company space.

The teams will be used to organize the users and to allow them to work together on projects. This field will be used to associate the users to a team/department/project, so the company should be able to create as many teams as they want.

Every team will have:

TEAMS TABLE (departments in the current schema in the database):

- id (cuid) @unique
- name (string)
- description (string)
- a list of Users

- createdAt DateTime @default(now())
- updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

### Users

The application will have the following information about the users:

USERS TABLE:

- id (string cuid) @unique
- email (string) @unique
- clerkUserId (string) @unique
- userFirstName (string?)
- userLastName (string?)
- role (Admin, Manager, Employee) default: Employee.
- status (Pending, Active, Blocked) default: Pending
- imageUrl (string?)
- jobTitle (string?)
- linkedInUrl (string?)

- companySlug (string?) - The slug of the company that the user belongs to

- createdAt (DateTime) @default(now())
- updatedAt (DateTime) @updatedAt
- lastLoginAt (DateTime)

Important Note on user roles: This will be used to identify the role of the user in the app.

- Admin users will have access to the admin dashboard and will be able to manage the companies, teams, and users.
- Manager users will have access to the manager dashboard and will be able to manage the teams and users.
- Employee users will have access to the part of the app with employee functionality and will be able to manage their own data.

Important Note on user status: This will be used to identify the status of the user in the app.

- Pending users are those that have not been approved by the admin yet.
- Active users are those that have been approved by the admin and are currently active in the app.
- Blocked users are those that have been blocked by the admin and are not allowed to access any functionality of the app.

#### Users management

The user management will have the following features:

1. The users will be able to register and manage their own data information, and:

- access to the app current functionality such as: register time-entry events (/jornada), see the list of his registered events (/registros), see and handle his uncompleted days or absences (/incidencias).
- access future functionality such as: request absences, see if other colleagues are working, and access various statistics.

2. Users can belong to a group, which could be used to asssociate them with a team (it could be used to associate them with a team, project or department), which will later be used to organize the visualization and accounting of data.

- A user can only belong to just one team group.

3. Users can login via Clerk and then they will be redirected to the application (/).

4. The user validation processwill be done manually by the admin user.

#### User validation process

- All users will signup into the application and the admin will have to manually accept them as valid users of the application.
- Once the user signsup with clerk, he will be redirected to the application and will see a route that displays a message "Your account is pending to be approved".
- All pending users will be listed an specific admin dashboard for User Management (/admin/users page), with the list of all users, pending users and active users. There will also be functionality to "Block" users and suspend their ability to log into the applications.
- The admin will be able to approve or reject them on the user management page.
- Once users are accepted by the admin, they will be able to login into the application and they will be redirected to the dashboard.

The admin will be able to see all the information about the users and will be able to edit some of the information.

The application will also have information about the current status of every user. This will be used to see if a user is working, on a break, or if they are not working at the moment. It has to be updated in real time according to the events that are being tracked by the application.

### Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard will have the following routes, located in the `/src/app/(admin)` folder, and will be comprised of the following tools:

- [ ] `/admin` will have a basic page to display to logged out users and will provide links to all the admin routes with the following sections:
  - [ ] `/admin/company`: Company Management. Access granted for "Admin" users only.
  - [ ] `/admin/teams`: Team Management. Access granted for "Admin" and "Managers" users.
  - [ ] `/admin/users`: User Management. Access granted for "Admin" users only.
  - [ ] `/admin/company/settings`: Company Default Settings - This will be used to configure the company information. For now, the app should only manage one company. Access granted for "Admin" users only.

## GOALS:

The goal is to add functionality to:

- [ ] Create Clerk project and setup Clerk to be used in the app.
- [ ] Enable user signup, loging and logout with Clerk based on user roles.
- [ ] Create the functionality needed to manage the company, teams, and users in the admin dashboard.
- [ ] Refactor current functionality to work with current logged in user with Clerk
- [ ] Create app settings and user preferences: company default settings.

## Tasks:

### Setup Clerk project and connect to the app:

- [ ] Create Clerk project and setup the app to use Clerk for authentication.
- [ ] Add basic user signup, loging and logout in the sidebar navigation (desktop and mobile) with Clerk to test the functionality.

### SCHEMA and DATABASE:

- [ ] Create and update the schema for the companies, teams, and users.
- [ ] Update the seed file to create the initial data for the companies, teams, and users. Try to maintain the same data as the current mock data.
- [ ] Update the Neon Database. If possible, try to maintain the same data stored in the server.

### SERVICES:

- [ ] Create the functionality to create, read, update and delete companies, teams, and users.
- [ ] Create the functionality to associate a user to a company. At this point there will be only one company in the app, so the user will be associated to that company by default.
- [ ] Create the functionality to associate a user to a team.

### UI:

- [ ] Create a basic public page to display to logged out users.
- [ ] Create an admin dashboard to manage companies
- [ ] Create an app settings section for admins to configure the company default settings.
- [ ] Create an admin dashboard to manage teams
- [ ] Create an admin dashboard for user management

### Update the app to work with the new Clerk authentication:

- [ ] Implement Clerk authentication based in Users Roles.
- [ ] If needed, improve the UI to manage the login/logout Clerk functionality to the sidebar navigation (to be used on desktop and mobile)

- [ ] Protect the routes that are only accessible to admin users. Everything in "(users)" folder
- [ ] Protect the routes that are only accessible to logged in users. Everything in "(admin)" folder

### Use Webhooks to update the database with information from Clerk:

- [ ] Configure Clerk to use Webhooks to send the events to the app. Enable: User Created, User Updated, User Deleted events.
- [ ] Install and Configure Svix to be used in the app.
- [ ] Configure Ngrok to enable testing webhooks in local development.
- [ ] Create API routes with webhooks to handle the events from Clerk to update the database with users information. Clerk uses Svix to send the events to the app.
  - [ ] Create User
  - [ ] Update User
  - [ ] Delete User

## REQUIREMENTS:

- [ ] If you need more information or details to analyze and plan implementation phases or tasks, ask me for more information.
- [ ] Be aware that we are using Clerk v2 for authentication which is different from Clerk v1. Access Clerk's most updated documentation to find the correct way to implement the new authentication functionality.

## CONSTRAINTS:

- Do not install or run commands on the composer. Always ask me to install any dependency or run commands on the terminal
- Do not create or modify any other functionality, design or file other than the ones required to add the new functionality.
- Ensure that all components created are mobile friendly and responsive. Please use the same design and layout as the rest of the app. Always use Shadcn/Tailwind CSS components and Lucide icons.
- Use Clerk library `npm install @clerk/nextjs` for user authentication and authorization.
- Use Svix library `npm install svix` for webhooks handling.
- Remember that we are already using Drizzle for database management and we have a working configuration with the schema defined in `src/db/schema.ts` and config file in `drizzle.config.ts` in the root folder of the project. DO NOT CHANGE OR MODIFY ANYTHING RELATED TO DRIZZLE CONFIG FILE. If in need to so, ask me for more permission.

Here is the config file for Drizzle:

```typescript
import * as dotenv from "dotenv"
import { defineConfig } from "drizzle-kit"
import { resolve } from "path"

// Load .env.local file
dotenv.config({ path: resolve(process.cwd(), ".env.local") })

if (!process.env.DATABASE_URL) {
  throw new Error("DATABASE_URL is not defined in .env.local")
}

export default defineConfig({
  schema: "./src/db/schema.ts",
  out: "./drizzle",
  dialect: "postgresql",
  dbCredentials: {
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL
  }
})
```

--- PROMPT ---

Let's start by building step by step this new epic task, and use the scratchpad to annotate your reasoning and progress, and to keep track of the tasks. Also use the scratchpad to write down any important lessons learned after the process.

I already did some of the work needed for setup:

- I created the project in Clerk website and setup the clerk application with email and Google authentication.
- I followed the instructions to get the API key which is now in the `.env.local` file in the variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.
- I created the `Middleware.ts` file to handle the authentication and added the ClerkProvider to the `layout.tsx` file.
- I added `ClerkProvider` to the app `layout.tsx` file wrapped around the `html` tag of the app.
- I ran the project on `http://localhost:3000` and checked that the app is working as expected.

### Known Issues

1. Next.js Headers Type Issue:
   - Problem: Type error with headers().get() in webhook endpoint
   - Impact: Typescript errors but functionality should work
   - TODO: Research correct typing for Next.js headers

### Lessons Learned

1. Always learn from past mistakes and important lessons learnt by experience relative to this project.
2. Always add proper comments to help understand the code by explaining "why" behind the "what" and the "how".
3. Always add comments to functions to explain what they do.
4. When working with async Server Components in Next.js 13+:
   - Use proper typing for auth objects
   - Verify middleware configuration with latest Clerk version
   - Test thoroughly with different auth states
5. When implementing Clerk middleware:
   - Use proper middleware configuration from latest docs
   - Verify auth object properties based on Clerk version
   - Handle both public and protected routes properly
   - Implement proper role-based checks
6. When implementing role-based auth:
   - Create utility functions for role checks
   - Keep role logic in a central location
   - Use proper typing for auth objects
   - Test thoroughly with different roles
7. When blocked by type issues:
   - Document the issue clearly
   - Implement alternative solution if possible
   - Research correct approach
   - Come back to fix when more information is available
8. When implementing protected routes:
   - Start with page-level protection first
   - Create necessary status pages
   - Implement proper redirects
   - Test thoroughly with different states
9. When implementing webhooks:

   - Always verify webhook signatures
   - Handle edge cases (missing data, invalid payloads)
   - Add proper error handling and logging
   - Test with real events from the service
   - Make sure webhook routes are public
   - Keep webhook secret secure in environment variables

10. IMPORTANT LESSON In Nextjs v15:

    - We need to await the headers() function
    - We need to await searchParams in Server Components
    - Update types to reflect that searchParams is now a Promise
    - Always await dynamic APIs before accessing their properties
    - This applies to: cookies(), headers(), draftMode(), params, and searchParams

11. When implementing data tables:

    - Use server-side pagination for large datasets
    - Implement proper loading states
    - Add error handling for failed operations
    - Use optimistic updates for better UX
    - Add proper filtering and sorting capabilities

12. When implementing admin dashboards:

    - Use URL-based filters for shareable links
    - Implement proper loading states for actions
    - Add optimistic updates for better UX
    - Use server actions for data mutations
    - Add proper error handling and notifications
    - Consider pagination for large datasets
    - Make tables responsive for mobile views

13. When implementing search functionality:

    - Use debouncing for search inputs to reduce unnecessary API calls
    - Keep local state for immediate UI feedback
    - Update URL params after debounce to maintain shareable links
    - Consider appropriate debounce delay (300-500ms is typical)
    - Handle empty search values appropriately

14. When implementing destructive actions:

    - Always use confirmation dialogs
    - Use clear and descriptive warning messages
    - Style destructive actions distinctly (red color)
    - Provide clear cancel options
    - Handle loading states during action
    - Prevent accidental triggers
    - Use appropriate icons to convey meaning

15. When organizing dropdown menus:
    - Group related actions using separators
    - Use consistent icon styling
    - Order items by frequency of use
    - Place destructive actions last
    - Use clear and concise labels
    - Add visual cues for destructive actions

## User Specific Lessons learned

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Always read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities

### Notes

- Must ensure mobile responsiveness ✅ (using responsive classes)
- Need to reuse time entry form from current-day.tsx ✅ (created TimeEntryDialog component)
- Real-time updates are critical for both lists ✅ (using router.refresh())
- Design matches current UI patterns ✅ (using Shadcn components)

### Known Issues

1. Next.js Headers Type Issue:
   - Problem: Type error with headers().get() in webhook endpoint
   - Impact: Typescript errors but functionality should work
   - TODO: Research correct typing for Next.js headers
   - TODO: Analyze if we can use the Google Maps Provider not at root level of the layout, but deeper in the tree, to avoid loading it on every page.

### Lessons Learned

1. Always learn from past mistakes and important lessons learnt by experience relative to this project.
2. Always add proper comments to help understand the code by explaining "why" behind the "what" and the "how".
3. Always add comments to functions to explain what they do.
4. When working with async Server Components in Next.js 13+:
   - Use proper typing for auth objects
   - Verify middleware configuration with latest Clerk version
   - Test thoroughly with different auth states
5. When implementing Clerk middleware:
   - Use proper middleware configuration from latest docs
   - Verify auth object properties based on Clerk version
   - Handle both public and protected routes properly
   - Implement proper role-based checks
6. When implementing role-based auth:
   - Create utility functions for role checks
   - Keep role logic in a central location
   - Use proper typing for auth objects
   - Test thoroughly with different roles
7. When blocked by type issues:
   - Document the issue clearly
   - Implement alternative solution if possible
   - Research correct approach
   - Come back to fix when more information is available
8. When implementing protected routes:
   - Start with page-level protection first
   - Create necessary status pages
   - Implement proper redirects
   - Test thoroughly with different states
9. When implementing webhooks:

   - Always verify webhook signatures
   - Handle edge cases (missing data, invalid payloads)
   - Add proper error handling and logging
   - Test with real events from the service
   - Make sure webhook routes are public
   - Keep webhook secret secure in environment variables

10. IMPORTANT LESSON In Nextjs v15:

    - We need to await the headers() function
    - We need to await searchParams in Server Components
    - Update types to reflect that searchParams is now a Promise
    - Always await dynamic APIs before accessing their properties
    - This applies to: cookies(), headers(), draftMode(), params, and searchParams

11. When implementing data tables:

    - Use server-side pagination for large datasets
    - Implement proper loading states
    - Add error handling for failed operations
    - Use optimistic updates for better UX
    - Add proper filtering and sorting capabilities

12. When implementing admin dashboards:

    - Use URL-based filters for shareable links
    - Implement proper loading states for actions
    - Add optimistic updates for better UX
    - Use server actions for data mutations
    - Add proper error handling and notifications
    - Consider pagination for large datasets
    - Make tables responsive for mobile views

13. When implementing search functionality:

    - Use debouncing for search inputs to reduce unnecessary API calls
    - Keep local state for immediate UI feedback
    - Update URL params after debounce to maintain shareable links
    - Consider appropriate debounce delay (300-500ms is typical)
    - Handle empty search values appropriately

14. When implementing destructive actions:

    - Always use confirmation dialogs
    - Use clear and descriptive warning messages
    - Style destructive actions distinctly (red color)
    - Provide clear cancel options
    - Handle loading states during action
    - Prevent accidental triggers
    - Use appropriate icons to convey meaning

15. When organizing dropdown menus:
    - Group related actions using separators
    - Use consistent icon styling
    - Order items by frequency of use
    - Place destructive actions last
    - Use clear and concise labels
    - Add visual cues for destructive actions

## User Specific Lessons learned

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Always read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities

### Notes

- Must ensure mobile responsiveness ✅ (using responsive classes)
- Need to reuse time entry form from current-day.tsx ✅ (created TimeEntryDialog component)
- Real-time updates are critical for both lists ✅ (using router.refresh())
- Design matches current UI patterns ✅ (using Shadcn components)

### Known Issues

1. Next.js Headers Type Issue:
   - Problem: Type error with headers().get() in webhook endpoint
   - Impact: Typescript errors but functionality should work
   - TODO: Research correct typing for Next.js headers
   - TODO: Analyze if we can use the Google Maps Provider not at root level of the layout, but deeper in the tree, to avoid loading it on every page.

### Lessons Learned

1. Always learn from past mistakes and important lessons learnt by experience relative to this project.
2. Always add proper comments to help understand the code by explaining "why" behind the "what" and the "how".
3. Always add comments to functions to explain what they do.
4. When working with async Server Components in Next.js 13+:
   - Use proper typing for auth objects
   - Verify middleware configuration with latest Clerk version
   - Test thoroughly with different auth states
5. When implementing Clerk middleware:
   - Use proper middleware configuration from latest docs
   - Verify auth object properties based on Clerk version
   - Handle both public and protected routes properly
   - Implement proper role-based checks
6. When implementing role-based auth:
   - Create utility functions for role checks
   - Keep role logic in a central location
   - Use proper typing for auth objects
   - Test thoroughly with different roles
7. When blocked by type issues:
   - Document the issue clearly
   - Implement alternative solution if possible
   - Research correct approach
   - Come back to fix when more information is available
8. When implementing protected routes:
   - Start with page-level protection first
   - Create necessary status pages
   - Implement proper redirects
   - Test thoroughly with different states
9. When implementing webhooks:

   - Always verify webhook signatures
   - Handle edge cases (missing data, invalid payloads)
   - Add proper error handling and logging
   - Test with real events from the service
   - Make sure webhook routes are public
   - Keep webhook secret secure in environment variables

10. IMPORTANT LESSON In Nextjs v15:

    - We need to await the headers() function
    - We need to await searchParams in Server Components
    - Update types to reflect that searchParams is now a Promise
    - Always await dynamic APIs before accessing their properties
    - This applies to: cookies(), headers(), draftMode(), params, and searchParams

11. When implementing data tables:

    - Use server-side pagination for large datasets
    - Implement proper loading states
    - Add error handling for failed operations
    - Use optimistic updates for better UX
    - Add proper filtering and sorting capabilities

12. When implementing admin dashboards:

    - Use URL-based filters for shareable links
    - Implement proper loading states for actions
    - Add optimistic updates for better UX
    - Use server actions for data mutations
    - Add proper error handling and notifications
    - Consider pagination for large datasets
    - Make tables responsive for mobile views

13. When implementing search functionality:

    - Use debouncing for search inputs to reduce unnecessary API calls
    - Keep local state for immediate UI feedback
    - Update URL params after debounce to maintain shareable links
    - Consider appropriate debounce delay (300-500ms is typical)
    - Handle empty search values appropriately

14. When implementing destructive actions:

    - Always use confirmation dialogs
    - Use clear and descriptive warning messages
    - Style destructive actions distinctly (red color)
    - Provide clear cancel options
    - Handle loading states during action
    - Prevent accidental triggers
    - Use appropriate icons to convey meaning

15. When organizing dropdown menus:
    - Group related actions using separators
    - Use consistent icon styling
    - Order items by frequency of use
    - Place destructive actions last
    - Use clear and concise labels
    - Add visual cues for destructive actions

## User Specific Lessons learned

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Always read the file before you try to edit it.
- Due to Cursor's limit, when you use `git` and `gh` and need to submit a multiline commit message, first write the message in a file, and then use `git commit -F <filename>` or similar command to commit. And then remove the file. Include "[Cursor] " in the commit message and PR title.

## Cursor learned

- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- Use 'gpt-4o' as the model name for OpenAI's GPT-4 with vision capabilities

### Notes

- Need to reuse time entry form from current-day.tsx ✅ (created TimeEntryDialog component)
- Real-time updates are critical for both lists ✅ (using router.refresh())
- Design matches current UI patterns ✅ (using Shadcn components)
- Created mock user configuration for development ✅
- Properly structured async Server Components ✅
- Added incidences stats with real-time updates ✅
- Admin dashboard should follow same responsive patterns ⏳
- Use Shadcn data table component for consistency
- Implement proper loading states for all actions
- Add toast notifications for user actions
- Use server actions for data mutations
- Admin dashboard is now responsive and functional ✅
- User management workflow is complete ✅
- Filtering and search work as expected ✅
- Search input is debounced for better performance ✅
- Ready to implement company management ⏳
- User role management is now complete with all roles ✅
- Delete user functionality added with confirmation ✅
- Dropdown menu is now better organized with separators ✅
- All actions have proper loading states ✅

### Auth Pages Layout Issue Resolution

Current Status:

- ✅ Identified deeper issue with layout structure
- ✅ Fixed marketing layout to remove duplicate SignedOut and html/body tags
- ✅ Updated auth layout to properly integrate with marketing layout
- ✅ Adjusted unauthorized page to fit within new layout structure

Root Cause:

- Marketing layout was incorrectly wrapping content with html/body tags and ClerkProvider
- Auth layout wasn't providing proper structure for auth pages
- Layout hierarchy wasn't properly established (root -> marketing -> auth)
- Duplicate SignedOut components causing rendering issues

Next Steps:

1. [ ] Test all auth routes to ensure they work correctly with new layout structure
2. [ ] Verify SignedOut component works correctly in auth layout
3. [ ] Test navigation between auth pages
4. [ ] Ensure proper layout inheritance from root through marketing to auth

Lessons Learned:

- Route groups with parentheses (like (auth)) need their own layout.tsx file
- Avoid duplicate layout wrappers (html, body, ClerkProvider)
- Keep layout hierarchy clean and well-structured
- Use SignedOut component at the appropriate level
- Pay attention to container and padding/margin inheritance
