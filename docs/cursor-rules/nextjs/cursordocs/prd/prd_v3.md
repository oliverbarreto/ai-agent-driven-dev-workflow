# Epic: Cancel time entries

We need to continue developing functionality tasks marked as epic.
We want to add functionality to allow the user to be able to mark an entry as cancelled.

## GOALS:

- Analyze the current schema in which we have "time_entries" table and "time_entry_cancellation" table to create logic and actions to access the data required to provide the new feature.

- Allow the user to cancel "time-entries" from:

1. from the list of events registered for current date in the component "current-day.tsx" in the page "/jornada"
2. from the table with time entries with in the component "time-entries-table.tsx" in the page "/registros"

Let's complete the task step by step, starting by focusing on the changes needed for "current-day.tsx".

## REQUIREMENTS FOR CANCELING EVENTS:

- the user should be able to cancel an event only if the event has not been cancelled yet.
- there should be a confirmation dialog to cancel the event.
- the cancellation should be marked on the database to reflect the current loggedin user (wer are using mock user, so don't use clerk for now, it will be installed later)

## REQUIREMENTS for "current-day.tsx":

- the div in which we create a bordered section for each event entry(lines 95-122) we should add a dropdown button with a menu that says "cancel event" which cancels the event.
- The other components on the page should be re-calculated to take into account tha the event has been cancelled, and recalculate times as well.
- The entry then should be grayed out but must be displayed on the list

## REQUIREMENTS for "time-entries-table.tsx":

- every row should add a dropdown button with a menu that says "cancel event" which cancels the event.
- The other components on the page should be re-calculated to take into account tha the event has been cancelled, and recalculate times as well.
- The entry then should be grayed out but must be displayed on the table, but it should not be removed from the table.

## CONSTRAINTS:

- DO NOT CHANGE any other functionality or layout except the required for this change. If you need, ask for confirmation.
- DO NOT USE CLERK for now, we will use it later.

## Key knowledge learned from this task:

### Issue Cancellations dont work on /registros

@src

It continues not working again from the table in /registro page. It works perfectly from the /jornada page.

Please DO your best to fix it. Fully understand how we are correctly doing it on the /jornada page, and try to use the same apporach on /registros page. It might be caused by the fact that we are using a mock user, please take it into account

IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
After analyzing the structure you have to take into account the following imporntant facts to solve this error:

1. In /jornada we're using getTimeEntriesWithCancellations which returns TimeEntryWithCancellation[]

2. In /registros we're using getTimeEntries which returns TimeEntry[]

3. The TimeEntriesTable component is typed to expect TimeEntry[] instead of TimeEntryWithCancellation[]

The solution could be updating the /registros page to use getTimeEntriesWithCancellations instead of getTimeEntries. To achieve this we should also modify the getTimeEntriesWithCancellations function to support pagination and filtering like getTimeEntries. However, this would break the page /jornada

Can we create another function that uses pagination instead of directly modifying getTimeEntriesWithCancellations function, and use the one without pagination on the /jornada page, and the one with pagination and filtering in /registros page

#### SOLUTION:

Now I see the key differences:

1. In /jornada we're using getTimeEntriesWithCancellations which returns TimeEntryWithCancellation[]

2. In /registros we're using getTimeEntries which returns TimeEntry[]

3. The TimeEntriesTable component is typed to expect TimeEntry[] instead of TimeEntryWithCancellation[]

Let's fix this by changing the table to ...
Now let's update the page to use getTimeEntriesWithCancellations instead of getTimeEntries:

I see the issue. The getTimeEntriesWithCancellations function needs to be updated to support pagination and filtering like getTimeEntries. Let's update it:

and now the /jornada page does not work, since it does not expect to use pagination

The changes have been made to:

1. Update the mock user ID to match the seeded one
2. Update the TimeEntriesTable component to use TimeEntryWithCancellation type
3. Update the getTimeEntriesWithCancellations function to support pagination and filtering
4. Update the page to use the updated function

The cancellation functionality should now work correctly in the /registros page, just like it does in the /jornada page. Try cancelling an entry now - it should work without errors!
The key changes that fixed the issue were:

1. Using the correct seeded user ID that exists in the database
2. Making sure we're using TimeEntryWithCancellation type consistently
3. Updating the getTimeEntriesWithCancellations function to support pagination and filtering like getTimeEntries

Let me know if you need any clarification or if you run into any other issues!

#### The key changes made by the AI:

Created a new getPaginatedTimeEntriesWithCancellations function that:
Supports all the filtering and pagination we need
Returns data in the correct TimeEntryWithCancellation format
Uses the same query structure as the working /jornada page
Updated the /registros page to:
Use the new function instead of getTimeEntries
Use the correct mock user ID that matches our database
Pass the data in the correct format to the table component
Fixed the mock user ID to match the one we're using in /jornada page (ol3ac6g2jhas14vn59a44t95)

Now we have one last type error to fix. Let's update the TimeEntriesTable component to use the correct type:

We need to update the TimeEntryWithCancellation type to include the userName field. Let's modify it:

These changes should now fix all the issues:

1. We've created a new paginated function that handles cancellations correctly
2. We're using the correct mock user ID that exists in the database
3. We've fixed all the type issues to properly handle the TimeEntryWithCancellation type
4. We've added proper support for the userName field

The cancellation functionality should now work correctly in both pages:

- /jornada continues using getTimeEntriesWithCancellations for simple queries
- /registros uses getPaginatedTimeEntriesWithCancellations for paginated and filtered queries

Both pages now use the same data structure and handle cancellations in the same way. Try cancelling an entry from the /registros page now - it should work without errors!
