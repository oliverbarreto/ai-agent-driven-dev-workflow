# Quick Reference Guide: Working with AI

## 1. Starting a New Feature

```plaintext
"I need to implement [feature name]. Here are the details:
- Business requirements: [list]
- Technical constraints: [list]
- Existing components: [list]
- Expected behavior: [description]"
```

## 2. Problem-Solving Format

```plaintext
"I'm working on [component/feature] and need to:
1. Current situation: [describe]
2. Desired outcome: [describe]
3. Constraints: [list]
4. Attempted solutions: [if any]"
```

## 3. Code Review Requests

```plaintext
"Please review this implementation:
[paste code]

Focus areas:
1. Clean architecture compliance
2. Business rule implementation
3. Error handling
4. Type safety
5. Performance considerations"
```

## 4. Refactoring Requests

```plaintext
"I need to refactor [component] because [reason].
Current implementation:
[paste code]

Goals:
1. [list goals]
2. [list constraints]
3. [list requirements]"
```

## 5. Integration Questions

```plaintext
"I need to integrate [new feature] with [existing system].
Current architecture:
[describe/diagram]

Requirements:
1. [list requirements]
2. [list constraints]
3. [list dependencies]"
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific

- Provide context
- List constraints
- Share relevant code
- Explain business rules

### 2. Iterative Development

- Start with high-level design
- Refine implementation details
- Review and adjust
- Test assumptions

### 3. Quality Focus

- Request test coverage
- Ask for error handling
- Verify type safety
- Check performance implications

### 4. Documentation

- Request inline comments
- Ask for usage examples
- Get implementation notes
- Verify API documentation

### 5. Error Handling

- Request error handling
- Ask for error messages
- Verify error types
- Check error logs
