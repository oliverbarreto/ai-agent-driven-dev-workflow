# Scratchpad

## Current Task:

FEATURE: Add user filter to admin time entries page

## Analysis:

- Currently, the admin time entries page shows all users' entries
- Need to add a user filter with text search functionality
- The filter should be implemented with debounce
- Empty text field should show all users
- Rest of filters should apply on button click
- Server action already includes user information in the response
- Search should work on first name, last name, and email address

## Current State:

- Admin page shows all users' time entries
- Filtering by user is not available
- Current filters: date range, type, concept, incidence, cancelled
- Filters apply on button click

## Implementation Requirements:

1. Add user search field to admin filter component
2. Implement debounce for user search
3. Update server action to handle user filter with name and email search
4. Maintain current UI design
5. Keep all existing functionality
6. No extra dependencies needed

### Implementation Plan:

1. Add user search field to admin filter schema and form
2. Implement debounce using useDebounce hook
3. Update server action to handle user search with name and email
4. Update URL params handling for user search
5. Test the functionality

### Tasks:

- [x] Add user search field to admin filter component
- [x] Implement debounce for user search
- [x] Update server action to handle user search
- [x] Add email search functionality
- [x] Test functionality

### Lessons Learned

1. When a feature is used in multiple places, it's important to identify all instances to maintain consistency
2. For modals that are used across different routes, consider creating a shared component
3. When adding new fields to existing functionality, check if the schema already supports it to avoid migrations
4. Using a shared component for modals helps maintain consistency in UI and functionality across the application
5. When updating functionality used in multiple places, it's important to update all instances to maintain feature parity
6. When displaying sensitive information like cancellation reasons, it's important to make it easily accessible but not overwhelming in the main UI
7. Using conditional rendering in dropdown menus helps keep the UI clean and contextual
8. When implementing search functionality, debouncing is important to prevent unnecessary API calls and improve performance
9. When adding new filters, it's important to maintain consistency with existing filter behavior
10. When implementing search functionality, consider all relevant fields that users might want to search by

# Task

@/admin/users/registros

NEW FEATURE: Currently on the page "/admin/users/registros", which can be accessed either by users with the admin or manager role, shows the list of time entries of all users in the app. We now need to add a new filter: we need to filter by user, and enable the "All" users options as well..

GOALS:

- Analyze how it is currrently implemented the filter functionality: logic, server actions and ui
- Do not change the completly the code with a new approach. Just focus on adding one more condition to the filter
- Implement the feature being thorough on not changing the current code, just adding the new condition.

REQUIREMENT:

- the user filter should be implemented having a text field in which the user filters the users, if the text field is empty it should be considered as retrieve all users on the filter condition.
- the search field should have a debounoce.
- the rest of the filters should apply when clicking on the button "apply filters"

CONSTRAINTS:

- Do not change the current UI design
- Do not change any functionality besides the one needed to fulfill this task
- Do not install any extra dependencies

Do not forget to use the scratchpad to analyze and update progress, take notes and lessons learned

Make a modification to allow the "user filter" to search the criteria in the first name, last name and email address of the user
