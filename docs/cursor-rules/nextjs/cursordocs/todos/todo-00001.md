# Scratchpad

## Current Task:

MEJORAS FUNCIONALIDAD "ADMIN/USERS":

-[x] REFACTOR: Make the columns of the table in "/admin/users" sortable

## Analysis:

- The users table is implemented in `src/components/tables/users-table.tsx`
- The data fetching is done in `src/app/(app)/(admin)/admin/users/page.tsx`
- Currently, the table is only sorted by creation date in descending order
- We need to add sorting functionality to all columns
- We can see an example of sortable columns in `src/app/(app)/(admin)/admin/users/registros/components/admin-time-entries-table.tsx`

## Current State:

- Table shows user data with columns: User, Role, Status, Department, Actions
- Data is fetched with pagination, search and filters
- Currently sorted by creation date in descending order only
- No sorting UI or functionality for other columns

## Implementation Requirements:

1. Add sorting functionality to all columns
2. Use direct click on column headers for sorting toggle
3. Maintain current functionality (search, filters, pagination)
4. Keep current UI design
5. No extra dependencies needed

### Implementation Plan:

1. Create SortButton component similar to the one used in admin-time-entries-table
2. Add sorting state and handlers in the users table component
3. Modify the getUsers function to accept and apply sorting parameters
4. Update the table header cells to use the new SortButton component
5. Test all sorting combinations while maintaining existing functionality

### Tasks:

- [x] Create SortButton component for users table
- [x] Add sorting state management
- [x] Update table headers with sort buttons
- [x] Modify getUsers function to handle sorting
- [x] Fix TypeScript errors in sorting implementation
- [x] Test sorting functionality

### Lessons Learned

1. The codebase already has a pattern for sortable tables in the admin-time-entries-table component that we can reuse
2. The current table implementation uses server-side sorting which we should maintain for consistency
3. When implementing sorting functionality, it's important to handle null values and provide appropriate fallbacks for comparison
4. Client-side sorting can break server-side pagination and filtering. It's better to handle sorting on the server side and use URL parameters to maintain state
5. When implementing sorting in Drizzle ORM, we need to be careful with the orderBy types and handle null values in the sort fields
6. When sorting by name, it's important to consider both firstName and lastName fields, and provide a consistent secondary sort field for better user experience
7. Nextjs searchParams are async in Nextjs 15 and they need to be a promise.

# Task

@(users)

REFACTOR: The columns of the table in "/admin/users" are not sortable

GOALS:

- Make the current columns sortable

REQUIREMENTS:

- Do not show a dropdown action to select and option, provide direct toggle of ascending/descending order when clicking on the collumn directly
- Do not change current functionality. The search and filters work perfectly.

CONSTRAINTS:

- Do not change the current UI design
- Do not change any functionality besides the one needed to fulfill this task
- Do not install any extra dependencies

Do not forget to use the scratchpad to analyze and update progress, take notes and lessons learned

---

Please thoroughly revise the last changes you made to @users-table.tsx since the sorting functionality breaks the page. Pagination dont work, serach and filter also dont work.

Check how you are filtering the results for the sorting since the page is providing correctly the async searchParams
