# Current Focus

- [ ] TODO: FEATURE: Add option to define the number of standard weekly working hours according to a specific date range, defining two types of calendars:

- Normal Schedule: weekly hours from Monday to Friday during the year. The administrator must define the number of standard weekly working hours for each day of the week that applies to the normal calendar except for the reduced schedule period that would apply in the defined date range.
- Reduced Schedule: weekly hours from Monday to Friday during the summer period. The administrator must define

  - the start date and end date of this schedule
  - the number of standard weekly working hours for each day of the week that applies to the reduced calendar except for the normal schedule period that would apply in the defined date range.

- The logic for calculating weekly hours worked must take this value into account to calculate the weekly hours worked and know the difference with the hours actually worked.

# TASK:

Let's build a new important FEATURE: Let's add the "/settings" page. We already have the navigations link.
