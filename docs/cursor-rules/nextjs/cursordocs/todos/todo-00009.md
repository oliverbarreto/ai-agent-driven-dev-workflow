# Current Focus

Objective:

We will create a part of a bigger app that can be implemented as a separate module. The objective is to have a configuration area inside another app. This new area will handle calendars that will apply for calculating working hours of employees of a company. These calendars will include holiday dates, and working days defined by the administrator of the app.

Goals:

We are going to create functionality in phases. As a senior expert developer your goal is to thoroughly analyze and define an implementation plan and design for the data model, logic, funcionatily and UI.

If you need to have more context, please ask before starting to implement the plan.

GOAL 1: "Calendarios Laborales"
First, we will create the skeleton of the settings page that will have three tabs: "Empresa", "Horarios" and "Calendarios".

The app already has a route for setigns with various tabs to provide different pieces of functionality. We have:

- http://localhost:3000/admin/settings/company to define company details configuration
- http://localhost:3000/admin/settings/locations to configure locations in the app
- http://localhost:3000/admin/settings/departments to configure departments/teams in the app
- http://localhost:3000/admin/settings/horarios to define work hour rules for diferent days of the week to apply to empeloyess
- http://localhost:3000/admin/settings/calendarios to define calendars configuration that will be used by the work hour rules by "horarios" functionality in the app when calculating work hours for employees.

We will focus on implemneting the "Calendario" tab which will use the rout "http://localhost:3000/admin/settings/calendarios". This tab will have, as you can see in the image provided, a sub-layout that will have a nested vertical tab menu in charge of showing different content: "Calendarios Festivos" and "Calendarios Laborales".

Create the page layout and bare-bones structure with no content yet. Do not create any other functionality yet.

# TASK:

Analyze and execute the task defined in @todo-00009.md

## Results:

We have implemented for the "Calendarios" tab in the settings area:

1. We created a nested vertical tab navigation structure with:

   - A main layout (layout.tsx) that includes the vertical tab navigation
   - A client component for the tab navigation (calendarios-tabs.tsx)
   - A redirect from the main page to the first tab (page.tsx)

2. We implemented two placeholder pages:
   - "Calendarios Festivos" (festivos/page.tsx) - For managing holiday calendars
   - "Calendarios Laborales" (laborales/page.tsx) - For managing work calendars

The structure we've created matches the requirements in the todo task. The UI should now display:

- The main settings tabs at the top (Empresa, Horarios, Calendarios, etc.)
- When "Calendarios" is selected, a vertical tab menu on the left with "Calendarios Festivos" and "Calendarios Laborales"
- The content area on the right showing the selected tab's content

All tasks have been marked as completed in the scratchpad. The implementation is a skeleton structure only, with no actual functionality yet, as specified in the requirements.
The app should now correctly handle the following routes:

- `/admin/settings/calendarios` (redirects to `/admin/settings/calendarios/festivos`)
- `/admin/settings/calendarios/festivos`
- `/admin/settings/calendarios/laborales`

You can navigate to these routes to verify that everything is working as expected.

#### Implementation Requirements:

- [x] Create a layout for the "Calendarios" tab
- [x] Implement a nested vertical tab menu
- [x] Add "Calendarios Festivos" and "Calendarios Laborales" as nested tabs
- [x] Ensure the layout matches the provided image
- [x] No need to implement actual functionality yet, just the UI structure

#### Implementation Plan:

- [x] Create a layout file for the "Calendarios" tab
- [x] Create a component for the nested vertical tab menu
- [x] Create placeholder pages for "Calendarios Festivos" and "Calendarios Laborales"
- [x] Update the main page.tsx to use the new layout and components

#### List of Tasks:

- [x] Create a calendarios-tabs.tsx component for the nested vertical tab menu
- [x] Create a layout.tsx file for the "Calendarios" tab
- [x] Create a festivos/page.tsx file for the "Calendarios Festivos" tab
- [x] Create a laborales/page.tsx file for the "Calendarios Laborales" tab
- [x] Update the main page.tsx to redirect to the first nested tab

## Lessons Learned

1. When a feature is used in multiple places, it's important to identify all instances to maintain consistency
2. For modals that are used across different routes, consider creating a shared component
3. When adding new fields to existing functionality, check if the schema already supports it to avoid migrations
4. Using a shared component for modals helps maintain consistency in UI and functionality across the application
5. When updating functionality used in multiple places, it's important to update all instances to maintain feature parity
6. When displaying sensitive information like cancellation reasons, it's important to make it easily accessible but not overwhelming in the main UI
7. Using conditional rendering in dropdown menus helps keep the UI clean and contextual
8. When implementing search functionality, debouncing is important to prevent unnecessary API calls and improve performance
9. When adding new filters, it's important to maintain consistency with existing filter behavior
10. When implementing search functionality, consider all relevant fields that users might want to search by
11. When implementing file downloads, use proper MIME types and Content-Disposition headers
12. When handling large datasets, consider using streaming or pagination if needed
13. When implementing export functionality, ensure all relevant data fields are included in a clear format
14. When reusing components across different pages, ensure they maintain consistent behavior and styling
15. When detecting device types, use useEffect to avoid hydration mismatches
16. When adding new enum fields to existing tables, always provide a default value to handle existing records
17. Consider adding new fields as nullable first if we're not sure about the default value
18. Test form validation thoroughly when adding new required fields
19. When adding new fields to forms, make sure to update all components that use the form to handle the new field
20. When displaying icons in a list, maintain consistent sizing and spacing for better visual alignment
21. Use muted colors for secondary information icons to maintain visual hierarchy
22. When adding new columns to tables, ensure they follow the same sorting and styling patterns as existing columns
23. When adding new fields to types, make sure to update all related functions and components that use that type
24. When adding sortable columns, ensure the sorting logic handles default values consistently
25. When reorganizing navigation, ensure that links are updated in all relevant components (sidebar, mobile nav, etc.)
26. When creating tabbed interfaces, use consistent styling and behavior across all tabs
27. When moving pages to new locations, ensure all imports and paths are updated correctly
28. **Avoid using `window.location.reload()` for data refreshing** as it resets UI state including tab selection
29. **Use Next.js's `router.refresh()` combined with `router.push(pathname)`** to maintain UI state while refreshing data
30. **Use `revalidatePath()` with the correct path patterns** in server actions to ensure data is properly refreshed
31. **For dynamic paths in `revalidatePath()`, use template literals with actual values** instead of path patterns with placeholders
32. **Consider using root layout revalidation** (`revalidatePath('/', 'layout')`) for changes that affect multiple parts of the app
33. **In React Query, use `refetchOnMount: "always"` and `staleTime: 0`** to ensure data is always fresh
34. **Replace `cacheTime` with `gcTime` in React Query v4** for controlling garbage collection of unused queries
35. **Use direct SQL queries instead of query builders** when you need to ensure you're getting fresh data
36. **Add timestamps to API responses** to help with cache busting
37. **Invalidate queries after operations complete** using `queryClient.invalidateQueries()`
38. **Reset form state when dialogs open** to prevent stale data from being displayed
39. **Extract locationId/departmentId from pathname** when needed for query invalidation
40. **Add small delays before navigation** after data operations to ensure cache is refreshed
41. **Use client components for UI elements that need to respond to route changes** like tab selection
42. **Separate client and server components** to maintain clear boundaries and optimize performance
43. **Use `useEffect` to force refetch** when components mount to ensure fresh data
44. **Handle dialog state properly** by closing dialogs before refreshing data to prevent UI glitches
45. **When implementing nested tab navigation**, create a layout file to handle the nested tabs and ensure proper routing
