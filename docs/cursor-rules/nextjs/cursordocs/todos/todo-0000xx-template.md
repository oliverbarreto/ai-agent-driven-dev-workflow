# Current Focus

Goals:

We are going to create functionality in phases. As a senior expert developer your goal is to thoroughly analyze and define an implementation plan and design for the data model, logic, funcionatily and UI.

If you need to have more context, please ask before starting to implement the plan.

Do not forget to use the "scratchpad.md" file to record and track your progress and thoughts with notes. Also use it analyze and save important lessons learned.

GOAL:
Now in this step we will focus on the second tab "Calendarios Festivos".

The purpose of this section will be to allow the user to add as many "holidays calendars" as he needs to use for a given localization or office for a given year.

You must analyze and provide an implementation plan for everything to implement this functionality: the model and schema, the logic and server actions, hooks, queries, and the UI. Please let me know if there is also any other thing that we must consider before implementing this feature.

# TASK:
