# Analysis

We need to add a new column to track the work location mode (office vs telework) independently of the existing concept field.

## 1. Schema Changes Required

We need to add a new field to the timeEntries table. Let's call it workMode with a new enum:

```typescript
;`schema.ts`

// New enum for work mode
export const workModeEnum = pgEnum("work_mode", ["office", "telework"])

// Add to timeEntries table
export const timeEntries = pgTable("time_entries", {
  // ... existing fields ...
  workMode: workModeEnum("work_mode").notNull().default("office") // Default to office for existing records
})
```

## 2. Database Migration Strategy

Much simpler now! We can add the column with a default value to handle existing records:

```sql
-- Create the enum type
CREATE TYPE work_mode AS ENUM ('office', 'telework');

-- Add the column with default value
ALTER TABLE time_entries
ADD COLUMN work_mode work_mode NOT NULL DEFAULT 'office';
```

## 3. Code Changes Required

### Forms/UI Updates

1. Update the event registration form to include the work mode selection:

```typescript
`event-registration-form.tsx`

// Add to form schema
const formSchema = z.object({
  // ... existing fields ...
  workMode: z.enum(["office", "telework"])
})

// Add to form UI
<FormField
  control={form.control}
  name="workMode"
  render={({ field }) => (
    <FormItem>
      <FormLabel>Work Mode</FormLabel>
      <Select onValueChange={field.onChange} defaultValue={field.value}>
        <FormControl>
          <SelectTrigger>
            <SelectValue placeholder="Select work mode" />
          </SelectTrigger>
        </FormControl>
        <SelectContent>
          <SelectItem value="office">Office</SelectItem>
          <SelectItem value="telework">Remote Work</SelectItem>
        </SelectContent>
      </Select>
      <FormMessage />
    </FormItem>
  )}
/>
```

2. Update time entries table to show the work mode:

```typescript
`time-entries-table.ts`

// Add to columns
{
  id: "workMode",
  header: "Work Mode",
  cell: (entry) => (
    <Badge variant={entry.workMode === "telework" ? "secondary" : "default"}>
      {entry.workMode === "telework" ? "Remote" : "Office"}
    </Badge>
  )
}
```

### Server Actions Update

```typescript
;`time-entries.ts`

// Update validation schema
const createTimeEntrySchema = z.object({
  // ... existing fields ...
  workMode: z.enum(["office", "telework"])
})
```

# Implementation Plan

0. Preparation Phase

   - Create database backup
   - Schedule maintenance window
   - Prepare rollback scripts

1. Database Changes (Zero downtime)

   - Create new enum type
   - Add new column with default value
   - No data migration needed since we're adding a new field with default

2. Backend Updates

   - Update schema.ts with new enum and field
   - Update server actions and validation
   - Update types

3. Frontend Updates

   - Add work mode selection to forms
   - Update tables and views to display work mode
   - Add filtering capabilities for work mode

4. Testing

   - Test new field in forms
   - Verify default values for existing records
   - Test filtering and reporting

5. Rollback Plan

   - First, create a backup of the current data:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE time_entries_backup AS SELECT * FROM time_entries;
   ```

   - This is a much simpler change than the previous plan, with minimal risk since we're just adding a new field with a default value. No data migration is needed for existing records.

   ```sql
   -- Restore from backup if needed
   DROP TABLE time_entries;
   CREATE TABLE time_entries AS SELECT * FROM time_entries_backup;
   ```

   ```sql
   -- If needed, remove the column
   ALTER TABLE time_entries DROP COLUMN work_mode;
   DROP TYPE work_mode;
   ```

6. Update Drizzle ORM

First Create New Drizzle Migration:

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

Then migrate:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

### Lessons Learned

1. When a feature is used in multiple places, it's important to identify all instances to maintain consistency
2. For modals that are used across different routes, consider creating a shared component
3. When adding new fields to existing functionality, check if the schema already supports it to avoid migrations
4. Using a shared component for modals helps maintain consistency in UI and functionality across the application
5. When updating functionality used in multiple places, it's important to update all instances to maintain feature parity
6. When displaying sensitive information like cancellation reasons, it's important to make it easily accessible but not overwhelming in the main UI
7. Using conditional rendering in dropdown menus helps keep the UI clean and contextual
8. When implementing search functionality, debouncing is important to prevent unnecessary API calls and improve performance
9. When adding new filters, it's important to maintain consistency with existing filter behavior
10. When implementing search functionality, consider all relevant fields that users might want to search by
11. When implementing file downloads, use proper MIME types and Content-Disposition headers
12. When handling large datasets, consider using streaming or pagination if needed
13. When implementing export functionality, ensure all relevant data fields are included in a clear format
14. When reusing components across different pages, ensure they maintain consistent behavior and styling
15. When detecting device types, use useEffect to avoid hydration mismatches
16. When adding new enum fields to existing tables, always provide a default value to handle existing records
17. Consider adding new fields as nullable first if we're not sure about the default value
18. Test form validation thoroughly when adding new required fields
19. When adding new fields to forms, make sure to update all components that use the form to handle the new field
20. When displaying icons in a list, maintain consistent sizing and spacing for better visual alignment
21. Use muted colors for secondary information icons to maintain visual hierarchy
22. When adding new columns to tables, ensure they follow the same sorting and styling patterns as existing columns
23. When adding new fields to types, make sure to update all related functions and components that use that type
24. When adding sortable columns, ensure the sorting logic handles default values consistently

# Analysis Task

@schema.ts @src

Given the current schema i want to add a new column in the time-entries table to register if an employee is working office or teleworking.

Please thoroughly analyze the parts of the app that need to be refactored. Tables, Views, Forms, etc.

Also i would like to have a script that i could run on the database server to change the current table withou loosing any data. Is this posible. Please guide me.

Do not change anything. As a senior developer expert in aspects like migrating data, provide your implementation plan

IMPORTANT: We do not have to modify the conceptEnum in the schema (the enum does not need to be modified to include "office" and "telework" concepts). What i mean is to add like a Boolean value that reflects if the employee is selecting to categorize the time entry registry as "in the office" or "telework". The point is that nothing from the current time restration changes, we just add a new option: i am working in the office, or i am working from home (telework)

# Implementation Task

@schema.ts @src

Please proceed with the given the implementation plan included in the file @todo-00006.md.

Do not forget to use the scratchpad to update your analysis and implementation plan, and to save your work. Also to save your important notes and lessons learned.

If you need to run any command let me know and i will do it manually in the terminal.
