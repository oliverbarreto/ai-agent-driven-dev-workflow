# Current Focus

MEJORAS FUNCIONALIDAD "/REGITROS":

- [x] TODO: FEATURE: Añadir opción a /registros para poder CREAR un "registro de entrada con detalles"

# Scratchpad

The implementation is now complete with the following features:

1. Added "Register with details" button to the /registros page:
   Button is placed between "Reset" and "Apply Filters" buttons
   Uses the same styling as existing buttons
   Maintains consistent spacing

2. Reused components from /jornada page:

   - EventRegistrationForm component
   - Time entry registration functionality
   - Device detection logic

3. Dialog functionality:

   - Opens a modal dialog for event registration
   - Uses the same form and validation
   - Handles incidences for past/future entries
   - Shows proper success/error messages

4. Maintained consistency:

   - Same behavior as in /jornada page
   - Same styling and UI elements
   - Same error handling and feedback

5. The button allows users to:
   - Click "Register with details" to open the dialog
   - Fill in the event details (type, concept, date, time, notes)
   - Submit the form to create a new time entry
   - Get feedback on success/failure
   - See the new entry in the list after refresh

# Task

@registros
@event-control-panel.tsx

Please add the same button that we have in the component @event-registration-control-panel.tsx in the "/jornada" page, in the "/registros" page. Place the button in the same row thatn "reset" and "apply filters" buttons with a nice separation.

The button should have the very same functionality: register a time entry with details of the current logged-in user

## CONSTRAINTS:

- Do not change the current UI design except the solicited change
- Do not change any functionality besides the one needed to fulfill this task
- Do not install any extra dependencies except the library proposed.

Do not forget to use the scratchpad to analyze and update progress, take notes and lessons learned
