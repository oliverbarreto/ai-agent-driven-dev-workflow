MEJORAS FUNCIONALIDAD "ADMIN/USERS/REGITROS": Descarga de CSV de datos de usuarios

- [x] TODO: FEATURE: Ampliar el filtro de la página "/admin/users/registros" para permitir filtrar por usuario, además de los filtros actuales. El text field debe tener un debounce.
- [x] TODO: FEATURE: Añadir posibilidad de descarga de CSV de descarga de /registros & /admin/users/registros... lo filtrado.

## Current Task:

FEATURE: Implement CSV export for admin time entries

## Analysis:

- Need to add CSV export functionality to admin time entries page
- Export should respect current filters
- Export should include all data, not just paginated results
- Need to use Papaparse library for CSV generation
- Must use Server Actions for data fetching and CSV generation
- Must handle large datasets efficiently
- Must ensure proper security with Clerk auth

## Current State:

- Admin page shows paginated time entries with filters
- No export functionality available
- Current filters: date range, type, concept, incidence, cancelled, user search
- Server action already handles all filters

## Implementation Requirements:

1. Create server action for CSV export
2. Add export button to UI with dropdown
3. Handle file download on client
4. Show loading state during export
5. Ensure security with Clerk auth
6. Handle large datasets efficiently
7. No extra dependencies except Papaparse

### Implementation Plan:

1. Install Papaparse library
2. Create server action for CSV export
3. Create ExportCSVButton component
4. Add export button to admin time entries page
5. Implement loading state
6. Test functionality with various data sizes

### Tasks:

- [x] Install Papaparse library
- [x] Create server action for CSV export
- [x] Create ExportCSVButton component
- [x] Add export button to UI
- [x] Test functionality

### Lessons Learned

1. When a feature is used in multiple places, it's important to identify all instances to maintain consistency
2. For modals that are used across different routes, consider creating a shared component
3. When adding new fields to existing functionality, check if the schema already supports it to avoid migrations
4. Using a shared component for modals helps maintain consistency in UI and functionality across the application
5. When updating functionality used in multiple places, it's important to update all instances to maintain feature parity
6. When displaying sensitive information like cancellation reasons, it's important to make it easily accessible but not overwhelming in the main UI
7. Using conditional rendering in dropdown menus helps keep the UI clean and contextual
8. When implementing search functionality, debouncing is important to prevent unnecessary API calls and improve performance
9. When adding new filters, it's important to maintain consistency with existing filter behavior
10. When implementing search functionality, consider all relevant fields that users might want to search by
11. When implementing file downloads, use proper MIME types and Content-Disposition headers
12. When handling large datasets, consider using streaming or pagination if needed
13. When implementing export functionality, ensure all relevant data fields are included in a clear format

# Task

@/admin/users/registros

NEW FEATURE OBJECTIVE: Implement a feature that allows users to download a CSV file containing all time entries based on the current filters from "/admin/users/registros". The data should be retrieved from the database (we are using Drizzle ORM and NeonDB). The download should work efficiently leveraging Next.js Server Actions.

## Feature Scope:

- Fetch all time entries from the database based on filters: date range, type, concept, is incidence, is cancelled, and user
- Format the data as a CSV file.
- Allow the user to download the file from the client UI.
- Ensure the entire dataset is retrieved (not just paginated results).
- Use Papaparse library. You have access to official documentaion @https://www.papaparse.com/docs

## Expected Output

- A working CSV export button in the UI (top right corner of the componet using a download icon that shows a dorpdown action list with an option labeled "Download CSV").
- A server action that retrieves all filtered records.
- A CSV file download with proper formatting and headers.

## Key Considerations

- Use Server Actions instead of API routes.
- Avoid fetching paginated data, retrieve all matching records from the DB taking into account the filters.
- Ensure security by checking user permissions with Clerk.
- Optimize performance by handling large datasets properly.
- Do not forget that Nextjs 15 uses async searchParams, in case needed.

## CONSTRAINTS:

- Do not change the current UI design except the solicited change
- Do not change any functionality besides the one needed to fulfill this task
- Do not install any extra dependencies except the library proposed.

## Initial thoughts on the Implementation Plan

### 1. Create a Server Action for CSV Generation

- Define a server action inside "src/app/actions/users-time-entries-export.ts".
- Fetch data from the time_entries table using Drizzle ORM.
- Apply all filters
- Format the result into CSV.
- Return a downloadable Response object with CSV headers.

### 2. Implement the Client Component

- Create a React component ExportCSVButton.tsx.
- Call the server action.
- Handle the file download on the client.
- Show a "exporting data" loading state while exporting the data.

### 3. Ensure Security & Performance

- Use Clerk authentication to ensure only authorized users can export data.
- Optimize the database query to prevent performance bottlenecks.
- Implement pagination fallback (e.g., streaming response if data is too large, the Papaparse library support streaming).
