# AI Software Development Life Cycle

## Resources

1. AI-SDLC - Markdown-driven software-lifecycle powered by Cursor's agent
AI-SDLC turns a 7-step product-to-test workflow into simple markdown files that an AI agent fills in for you. Think chat-driven development that stays under version control and never forgets a step.

2. The BMAD-Method 3.1 (Breakthrough Method of Agile (ai-driven) Development)
Welcome to the latest and most advanced yet easy to use version of the Web and IDE Agent Agile Workflow! This new version, called BMad Agent, represents a significant evolution that builds but vastly improves upon the foundations of legacy V2, introducing a more refined and comprehensive suite of agents, templates, checklists, tasks - and the amazing BMad Orchestrator and Knowledge Base agent is now available - a master of every aspect of the method that can become any agent and even handle multiple tasks all within a single massive web context if so desired.

4. Cursos Memory Bank
I am Cursor, an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.
