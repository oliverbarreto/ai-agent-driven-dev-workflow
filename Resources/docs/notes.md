#### Prompt for AI Agent - Create Requirements for a New Feature

**Create Requirements for a New Full Application**: As a expert product manager, the AI agent should create the requirements for a new application adding a new feature based on the analysis document. The output will be a PRD (Product Requirements Document) in Markdown format specifically crafted to incroporate a new feature.


#### Prompt for AI Agent - Create Requirements for a New Feature

**Create Requirements for a New Feature**: As a expert product manager, the AI agent should create the requirements for adding a new feature based on the analysis document. The output will be a PRD (Product Requirements Document) in Markdown format specifically crafted to incroporate a new feature.

EXAMPLE:
```markdown 
I want you to act as a Product Manager for the "EXAMPLE web" app. We need a courses overview page with standardize best practices which you also find on other popular content management systems. Do not code anything yet; instead, deeply think about which requirements we need and how the page should operate and descibre the use sies in detail in a Product Requirements Document markdown file.

The analysis document MUST include:
- 1. Overview: purpose, background and scope of the application
- 2. Features: list of features, feature analysis and key features prioritization
- 2. User Personas, Needs (primary/secondary), and user journeys
- 3. User Stories for each type of persona
- 4. Functional Requirements: core functionalities and technical (performance, responsiveness, security, accesibility, etc.) requirements
- 5. User Interface Requirements: layout requirements, initeractions (search, filtering, etc.), main components
- 6. Non-functional Requirements: performance, security, scalability, maintainability

**PRD DOCUMENT Table of Contents:**
- Goals and objectives of the application
- Market positioning of the application
- User personas and user journeys
- Feature analysis and Key features prioritization
- User Stories for each type of persona
- Roadmap planning suggestions
- Future Considerations for: potential enhancements, scalability and maintainability
- Analytics Requirements
- Success metrics and KPIs: primary and secondary (does not have to be exhaustive)
- Market research and competitive analysis (does not have to be exhaustive)

For describing technical concepts, you should include Mermaid diagrams in this Markdown file.

```

⚠️ IMPORTANT: The human user must manually add the new FEATURE PRD Markdown document to the project knowledge.

- Each task is a checkbox item that you can check when you finish it. 
- They can have three types of tasks:
  1. **Core tasks:** are the core tasks to complete the project.
  2. **Refactors:** are tasks to refactor the code to improve the code quality.
  3. **Bugs:** are tasks to fix bugs in the code.

- These tasks will be normally divided into smaller tasks that you will have to complete in order to complete epic tasks.
