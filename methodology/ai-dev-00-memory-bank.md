## Project Memory Bank Key Files

The project memory bank is a collection of key files that are used to store the project documentation, analysis, and implementation plans. 

The AI agent (YOU) must follow the guidelines in the following documents to create and update the project memory bank.

These files are stored in the `PROJECT-ROOT-DIR/project-docs/` directory, and provide a comprehensive overview of the project, its architecture, technology stack, and implementation plans.

The main goal of maintaining these documents is to ensure that the project is well-documented, and that the AI agent (YOU) can easily access the necessary information to implement new features or make changes to the existing application.

Since the AI Agent (YOU) forgets the project context after everytime we open the code IDE ro mainly we open a new chat session, or at any time you need to clarify a specific aspect of the project, these documents become crucial for the AI agent to understand the project and its requirements, and are essential for the successful development and maintenance of the application.

We define two levels of documentation:
1. **General Project Documentation**: This includes the overall project documentation, architecture, technology stack, and implementation plans.
2. **Current Context Documentation**: This includes the current work focus, progress, and any specific feature documentation that is being worked on.

## General Project Documentation files

- `project-technical-analysis.md` - technical analysis of the application document
- `project-app-architecture.md` - application architecture document
- `project-technology-stack-and-project-structure.md` - Technology Stack and project structure document
- `project-prd.md` - Full application PRD document
- `project-prd-feature-XYZ.md` - Feature specific PRD document
- `project-implementation-plan.md` - Implementation plan document
- `project-implementation-plan-feature-XYZ.md` - Feature specific implementation plan document

## Current Context files
- `project-active-context-and-progress.md` - This file will hold information of the current context can also be referenced as "The Scratchpad" includes the current work focus, current implementation knowledge and progress tracking.
